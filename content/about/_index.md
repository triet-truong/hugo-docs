# About me

## Triet (Minh) Truong

Software Engineer since 2019, specialized in Backend development and engineering. Interested in DevOps, cloud architecture as well.

I use this blog as a professional (Jedi) archive, a place to write down accumulated knowledge and data on various technical topics in a organized structure, such as little command-lines I found useful or efficient automation tools. Human memory is volatile so I can count on a more persistent storage, like this blog. Words are not only imprinted in pages but also in my mind.
